greet();
function greet() {
  console.log("Hi!");
}



// here we can see the greet is the function declaration
// fd is the hoisted in nature , means , the function is move inside the
// variable environment object and initial value is function itself
// so we can call this function  and we can get the value of  (Hi!)
